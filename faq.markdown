# Why walk the Pennine way
The Pennine Way was the first British National Trail, and provides a satisfying challenge. It runs through some beautiful areas, and provides a chance to explore some lesser known areas of the UK.

# How long does it take to walk the Pennine Way?
Most people take between 14 and 21 days, although I have met someone who did the walk in 10 days. The record currently stands as 2 days, 10 hours, 4 minutes and 53 seconds, set by John Kelly in May 2021.

# How hard is it
The Pennine Way can be challenging with some long days, and poor weather can make it worse. Having said that, conditions on the trail have improved substantially since the 80s, when people would find themselves lost and mired in nasty bogs. If you're confident to manage a couple of long days hiking then you'll probably manage the Pennine Way, as the body soon adjusts to the load. If you're not sure, then it's good to get experience, possibly on a shorter trail such as the Ridgeway or the South Downs Way.

Much of the Pennine Way's fearsome reputation comes from the walk's early days, when the early stages could be gruelling. Before these routes were paved, people could find themselves falling into deep bogs. This has been improved massively - that's not to say you won't ever get your feet wet, but you will hopefully keep your knees dry. 

I've faced some grim days walking on the Pennine Way, but it's all seemed worthwhile once I'm dry and warm again. A bad day walking beats any day stuck in a office.

# When is the best time to walk the Pennine Way
Most people walk the trail between May and September, when the weather is relatively mild - walking the route during winter months can be extremely challenging. It is also good to avoid school holidays when there will be competition for accommodation in some places.

# Which direction should I walk the trail
Most people tend to walk from south to north.

# How do I find accommodation?
Finding accommodation on the Pennine Way can be a challenge. One simple solution is to go through one of the [booking agencies](https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/pennine-way/holiday-planning) who can manage this for you. Otherwise, the National Trails website includes a list of [Pennine Way accommodation](https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/trails/pennine-way/accommodation/). 

# Is it possible to wild camp
While wild camping on the route is not officially permitted, many people do manage to do the Pennine Way with wild camping. Becky the Traveller has produced a guide to [wild-camping on the Pennine Way](https://www.beckythetraveller.com/walking-pennine-way-wild-camping/) 

# What equipment do I need to bring
There are a number of packing guides online which can be found via a search engine. A few things you should definitely consider bringing are:
* Maps - while the route is well sign-posted, it would be dangerous to rely on just these or even a guidebook. As well as individual OS maps, Cicerone have produced a [Pennine Way map book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pennine-Way-Map-Booklet-Distance/dp/185284907X/)
* Waterproofs - even during the summer, the Pennine Way can throw out some interesting weather. 
* A good rucksack with a rain cover
* Decent walking boots
