There are numerous interesting sites along the Pennine Way. This page aims to collect some of the myths and stories.

# Edale
A short distance out of Edale there is a simple bench with a short poem carved into its seat:
> Office Bustle for Leaves Rustle <br/>
> Mobiles Ringing for Birds Singing <br/>
> Lovers Rejection for Waters Reflection <br/>
> Twenty-First Century for Glimpse of Eternity‚Äù 

# Bleaklow
Near Bleaklow is the [wreckage of a B-29 Superfortress place](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/b-29-over-exposed-crash-site) which crashed in November 1948. 

It is said that the [ghosts of Roman soldiers](https://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/hauntings/bleaklow-head-and-surrounding-moorland/) can be seen on the moors near Bleaklow.
 
# Top Withens
The ruins at Top Withens are said to be the inspiration for Wuthering Heights in the Emily Bronte novel. The sign placed there is fairly stern about this not being the case, but the site remains a pilgrimage place.

# Malham
Malham Tarn is the setting for Charles Kingsley's novel *The Water Babies*, which was inspired by a stay at Malham Tarn House in 1958.

More recently, Malham Cove was used as a filming location for *Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows*. 

# Pen-y-ghent Cafe
Before its closure, the Pen-y-ghent cafe was one of the most renown stops on the Pennine Way. The cafe maintained books listing Pennine Way-ers who had passed through, one of several sets on the trail. It also ran a clocking in/out system for the Yorkshire three peaks. It's loss is a sad one for the trail.

# Tan Hill Inn
Tan Hill Inn is the highest pub in the UK, and during winter can become completely cut off. During Storm Anwen in 2021, 61 guests and 7 staff were [trapped for several days](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-59459150) after seeing an Oasis tribute band. The Innhas featured in [an advert for Everest double-glazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBPWJfq4dDA) as well as [the 2017 Waitrose Christmas advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in8XhKocXlM), which caused some controvery as Waitrose do not actually offer deliveries to that area,

Greg's Hut is a 19th century cottage that was renovated in 1969 as a shelter in memory of mountaineer John Gregory.
