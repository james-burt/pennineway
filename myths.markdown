There are numerous interesting sites along the Pennine Way. This page aims to collect some of the myths and stories.

# Edale
A short distance out of Edale there is a simple bench with a short poem carved into its seat:
> Office Bustle for Leaves Rustle <br/>
> Mobiles Ringing for Birds Singing <br/>
> Lovers Rejection for Waters Reflection <br/>
> Twenty-First Century for Glimpse of Eternity‚Äù 

# Kinder Scout
The reason for the Pennine Way starting at Edale is so that it passes Kinder Scout, one of the central locations in the struggle for access rights for walkers. In 1932 this was the site of the [Kinder Trespass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_trespass_of_Kinder_Scout) where hundreds of walkers organised a mass trespass onto Kinder Scout. This is said to be the most successful act of civil disobedience in British history, leading to the passage of the National Parks legislation in 1949.

# Bleaklow
Near Bleaklow is the [wreckage of a B-29 Superfortress place](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/b-29-over-exposed-crash-site) which crashed in November 1948. 

It is said that the [ghosts of Roman soldiers](https://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/hauntings/bleaklow-head-and-surrounding-moorland/) can be seen on the moors near Bleaklow.

# Wessenden Moor
This was the location for one of Ashley Jackson's 'Framing the Landscape' pieces.

# Top Withens
The ruins at Top Withens are said to be the inspiration for Wuthering Heights in the Emily Bronte novel. The sign placed there is fairly stern about this not being the case, but the site remains a pilgrimage place for lovers of the book.

# Malham
Malham Tarn is the setting for Charles Kingsley's novel *The Water Babies*, which was inspired by a stay at Malham Tarn House in 1958.

More recently, Malham Cove was used as a filming location for *Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows*. 

# Pen-y-ghent Cafe
Before its closure, the Pen-y-ghent cafe was one of the most renown stops on the Pennine Way. The cafe maintained books listing Pennine Way-ers who had passed through, one of several sets on the trail. It also ran a clocking in/out system for the Yorkshire three peaks. It's loss is a sad one for the trail.

# Tan Hill Inn
Tan Hill Inn is the highest pub in the UK, and during winter can become completely cut off. During Storm Arwen in 2021, 61 guests and 7 staff were [trapped for several days](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-59459150) after seeing an Oasis tribute band. The Inn has featured in [an advert for Everest double-glazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBPWJfq4dDA) as well as [the 2017 Waitrose Christmas advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in8XhKocXlM), which caused some controvery as Waitrose did not offer deliveries to that area,

# Low Force
This waterfall was one of the shooting locations for Netflix's Witcher TV series.

# High Force
At a height of 21m, High Force is Britain's biggest waterfall. There is another coin tree near here.

# Cow Green Reservoir
This valley was once thought to be home to Peg Powler, a spirit that dragged children into the water if they came too close to the edge. The froth on some parts of the River Tees was referred to as 'Peg Powler's Suds'.

# Hannah's Meadows
Hannah Hauxwell (1926-2018) was a farmer who became famous after the 1972 documentary [Too Long a Winter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC5WeuLHUdU), which described the harsh conditions faced by farmers in the High Pennines. Hauxwell ran Low Birk Hatt farm by herself with no electricity or running water. Later documentaries featured her travelling the world. Hauxwell's farm is now a nature reserve, [Hannah's Meadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah%27s_Meadows).

# Greg's Hut
Greg's Hut is a 19th century cottage that was renovated in 1969 as a shelter in memory of mountaineer John Gregory. During the Spine Race, this functions as the [highest noodle bar in the UK](https://hillcraftguidedwalking.com/2013/10/06/141-two-men-and-a-dog-and-the-highest-noodle-bar-in-the-uk/).

# Cross Fell
This was once known as 'Fiend's Fell', and believed to be inhabited by evil sprits until it was blessed by St. Augustine of Canterbury. Some say it was renamed Cross Fell to mark Christian tradition; others that the word 'cross' refers to the anger of the spirits.

Cross Fell is home to [the Helm Wind](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/types-of-weather/wind/helm-wind), said by the Met Office to be the only named wind in the UK. This north-easterly wind can cause a helmet of cap of clouds to appear above Cross Fell.
