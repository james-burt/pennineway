There are numerous interesting sites along the Pennine Way. This page aims to collect some of the myths and stories.

# Edale
A short distance out of Edale there is a simple bench with a short poem carved into its seat:
> Office Bustle for Leaves Rustle 
> Mobiles Ringing for Birds Singing 
> Lovers Rejection for Waters Reflection
> Twenty-First Century for Glimpse of Eternity‚Äù 
 
# Top Withens
The ruins at Top Withens are said to be the inspiration for Wuthering Heights in the Emily Bronte novel. The sign placed there is fairly stern about this not being the case, but the site remains a pilgrimage place.

# Greg's Hut
Greg's Hut is a 19th century cottage that was renovated in 1969 as a shelter in memory of mountaineer John Gregory. During the Spine Race, this functions as the [highest noodle bar in the UK](https://hillcraftguidedwalking.com/2013/10/06/141-two-men-and-a-dog-and-the-highest-noodle-bar-in-the-uk/).
