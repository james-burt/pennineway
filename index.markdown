| *The Pennine Way* |
 

The Pennine Way is a 268-mile national trail from Edale to Kirk Yetholm, just the other side of the Scottish border. It opened in 1965 and was the UK's first such trail.

This website will provide an overview of the route and some of the things that can be found there. It was launched in October 2022 and is a work in progress. If you have any questions or comments then please <a href="mailto:james@orbific.com">email me</a>.
