* The [Rambling Man](https://ramblingman.org.uk/) website has an excellent [one page guide to the Pennine Way](https://ramblingman.org.uk/planningatrip/pennine_way/) which provides clear information for a walk.
* I use the [Trailblazer Pennine Way guide](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pennine-Way-2019-large-scale-Trailblazer/dp/191271602X/) for all my walks on the Pennine Way. It contains useful hand-drawn maps of the route, along with accommodation and planning information. Highly recommended. 
* The Pennine Challenge ([Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmXMM9pFUbpiCv0mZjX7NUOqKFx2xO5JQ)) is a 1982 documentary about four young people walking the Pennine Way. The conditions they face in August gives an idea of how tricky the route could be before the flagstones were in place. It's also interesting to see how different documentaries were in the 80s.
* [The Pennine Way from the Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWVu3Hoz_6w) is a fantastic 43-minute aerial tour of the Pennine Way.
