* The [Rambling Man](https://ramblingman.org.uk/) website has an excellent [one page guide to the Pennine Way](https://ramblingman.org.uk/planningatrip/pennine_way/) which provides clear information for planning the walk.
* The National Trails website contains [an official page](https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/trails/pennine-way/) for the trail. This includes up to date information on path closures and diversions.
* I use the [Trailblazer Pennine Way guide](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pennine-Way-2019-large-scale-Trailblazer/dp/191271602X/) for all my walks on the Pennine Way. It contains useful hand-drawn maps of the route, along with accommodation and planning information. Highly recommended. 
* Another popular guidebook is the [Cicerone Pennine Way Guide](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pennine-Way-National-separate-Cicerone/dp/1852849061)
* The Pennine Challenge ([Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmXMM9pFUbpiCv0mZjX7NUOqKFx2xO5JQ)) is a 1982 documentary about four young people walking the Pennine Way. The conditions they face in August gives an idea of how tricky the route could be before the flagstones were in place. It's also interesting to see how different documentaries were in the 80s.
* [The Pennine Way from the Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWVu3Hoz_6w) is a fantastic 43-minute aerial tour of the Pennine Way.
* [Jasmin Paris](http://jasminfellrunner.blogspot.com)'s account of her [2019 vistory in the Spine race](http://jasminfellrunner.blogspot.com/2020/01/spine-race.html) is a must-read. This is one of the most-gruelling races in the world, and Paris pulled off a stunning upset.
* [One Man and His Bog](https://www.amazon.co.uk/One-Man-His-Barry-Pilton/dp/0552127965/) is a book about travelling the Pennine Way in the 'bad old days' when the early stages did not have flagstones.  
* [The Publishing History of Wainwright's Pennine Way Companion](https://www.alfredwainwright.co.uk/pennine-way-companion/). 
* Tom Stephenson's article [Wanted - A Long Green Trail](https://www.skyware.co.uk/h2h/wanted.html) (June 22nd 1935) is considered to be initial inspiration for the Pennine Way.
* The [Pennine Way Association](https://www.penninewayassociation.co.uk/) was [closed in 2016](https://www.penninewayassociation.co.uk/pwanews/closure-of-the-pwa-some-votes-of-thanks.html) but their website has been left up for the time being. This includes a 49-item [Pennine Way Bibliography](https://www.penninewayassociation.co.uk/further-reading).
