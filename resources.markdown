* Cicerone has produced a [Pennine Way Map Booklet](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/185284907X/) which contains the Ordnance Survey 1:25000 scale maps for the route, saving money and hassle in comparison to buying the sheet maps.

* [Jasmin Paris](http://jasminfellrunner.blogspot.com)'s account of her [2019 vistory in the Spine race](http://jasminfellrunner.blogspot.com/2020/01/spine-race.html) is a must-read. This is one of the most-gruelling races in the world, and Paris pulled off a stunning upset. (2019)
* [penninewayers](https://penninewayers.wordpress.com/) describes what happened on Steve, Derek and Tim's second attempt to walk the Pennine Way after poor weather stopped their first attempt. (2015)

# Video 
* The Pennine Challenge ([Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmXMM9pFUbpiCv0mZjX7NUOqKFx2xO5JQ)) is a 1982 documentary about four young people walking the Pennine Way. The conditions they face in August gives an idea of how tricky the route could be before the flagstones were in place. It's also interesting to see how different documentaries were in the 80s.
* [The Pennine Way from the Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWVu3Hoz_6w) is a fantastic 43-minute aerial tour of the Pennine Way.
* Paul Rose presented a [four part BBC series](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05qt4kn/episodes/guide) celebrating the Pennine Way's 50th anniversary.
