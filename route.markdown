The Pennine Way can be comfortably divided up into 17 day-long stages. According to wikipedia, the route includes 287 gates, 249 timber stiles, 183 stone stiles and 204 bridges; and the route provides 458 way marks.

    - The first stage passes Kinder Scout, one of the most important places in the history of British walking.

# Edale to Crowden (16 miles)
Starting out at the Old Nag's Head public house in Edale, the trail begins with a steep climb up the stairs of Jacob's Ladder to pass round the famous summits of Kinder Scout and Bleaklow, crossing the A57 Snake Road before reaching Torside Reservoir and Crowden. Andrew McCloy writes about this section that '*There are tales of miserable, limping walkers throwing in the towel when they reach the A57, less than ten miles from the start at Edale, and wearily trudging the two and a half miles down the road to the Snake Pass Inn, or even west to Glossop. Others use the location to jettison unwanted items.*' This section is no longer the boggy, misty nightmare it was in the early days of the trail, thanks to extensive paving.

# Crowden to Standedge
# Standedge to Calder Valley
Day 3 includes the impressive monument at Stoodley Pike, above the town of Todmorden. Near the descent into the Calder Valley walkers have the option of taking the Hebden Bridge Loop into the famous town. While Hebden Bridge was not part of the original Pennine Way it's earned its place as the birthplace of the [Walkers are Welcome](https://walkersarewelcome.org.uk/) scheme. It's a good place for a comfortable stay. If energy allows, a climb to the village of Heptonstall is worth the effort.

# Malham to Horton-in-Ribblesdale
The 6th day begins with Malham Cove, one of the hightlights of the Pennine Way. Towards the end of the day is the ascent of Pen-y-ghent (696m/2283ft) before descending into the village of Horton-in-Ribblesdale.
# Horton-in-Ribblesdale to Hawes
# Hawes to Keld
Keld is the point at which the Pennine Way crosses the Coast-to-Coast path.
# Keld to Tan Hill
The isolated [Tan Hill Inn](https://www.tanhillinn.com/) (528m/1,732ft) is the highest pub in the British Isles.
# Tan Hill to Middleton-in-Teesdale
# Middleton-in-Teesdale to Dufton (20 miles)
This is by far my favourite section of the trail. The day begins by following the river Tees, with the impressive waterfalls at Low Force and High Force. There is a section below cliffs leading to another waterfall at Cauldron Snout. The day finished with High Cup Nick, possibly one of the best views in England.
