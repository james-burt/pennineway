The Pennine Way can be comfortably divided up into 17 day-long stages. According to wikipedia, the route includes 287 gates, 249 timber stiles, 183 stone stiles and 204 bridges; and the route provides 458 way marks. The exact stopping points will depend on the available accommodation.

    - The first stage passes Kinder Scout, one of the most important places in the history of British walking.

# Edale to Crowden (16 miles)
Starting out at the Old Nag's Head public house in Edale, the trail begins with a steep climb up the stairs of Jacob's Ladder to pass round the famous summits of Kinder Scout and Bleaklow, crossing the A57 Snake Road before reaching Torside Reservoir and Crowden. Andrew McCloy writes about this section that '*There are tales of miserable, limping walkers throwing in the towel when they reach the A57, less than ten miles from the start at Edale, and wearily trudging the two and a half miles down the road to the Snake Pass Inn, or even west to Glossop. Others use the location to jettison unwanted items.*' This section is no longer the boggy, misty nightmare it was in the early days of the trail, thanks to extensive paving.

# Crowden to Standedge (11 miles)
The second day is somewhat shorter than the first, beginning with a long climb up a valley, and some sharp drops towards the top. From there the route cross Black Hill towards the A635, where there may be a waiting food van. A series of reservoirs takes the route to the tiny village of Standedge, although more accommodation can be found a couple of miles away in Marsden.

# Standedge to Calder Valley (14½ miles)
Day 3 includes the impressive monument at Stoodley Pike, above the town of Todmorden. Near the descent into the Calder Valley walkers have the option of taking the Hebden Bridge Loop into the famous town. While Hebden Bridge was not part of the original Pennine Way it's earned its place as the birthplace of the [Walkers are Welcome](https://walkersarewelcome.org.uk/) scheme. It's a good place for a comfortable stay.

# Calder Valley to Ickornshaw (15½ miles)
It's a steep climb out of the Calder Valley and onto Heptonstall Moor. The route passes some reservoirs as it travels through the moorland until reaching the ruined farmhouse at Top Withens, incorrectly claimed as the model for Wuthering Heights. It's possible to divert from here, via the Bronte waterfalls, to Haworth. Otherwise the route passes Ponden reservoir before rising up the valley-side to Ickornshaw.

# Ickornshaw to Malham (17 miles)
![Gargrave](/assets/gargrave.jpg)
This section takes walkers from the Peak District to the Yorkshire Dales. The day's route passes through a number of small villages: Lothersdale and Thornton-in-Craven, East Marston and Gargrave. The last of these includes the famous Dalesman Cafe. From here, the route continues to Malham. It's worth taking the time while here to visit the impressive Gorsdale Scar. 

# Malham to Horton-in-Ribblesdale (14½ miles)
The sixth day begins with Malham Cove, one of the hightlights of the Pennine Way. Towards the end of the day is the ascent of Pen-y-ghent (696m/2283ft) before descending into the village of Horton-in-Ribblesdale.

# Horton-in-Ribblesdale to Hawes (13½ miles)
A day of following long stone walls, with relatively little climbing to reach the bustling town of Hawes, home to the Wensleydale Creamery.
 
# Hawes to Tan Hill (16 miles)
The day starts with the climb of Great Shunner Fell, before descending into Thwaite. The path comes close to Keld, where it crosses the Coast-to-Coast path. There are good views of the Nine Standard before the route meets the isolated [Tan Hill Inn](https://www.tanhillinn.com/) (528m/1,732ft) is the highest pub in the British Isles.

# Tan Hill to Middleton-in-Teesdale (16½ miles)
# Middleton-in-Teesdale to Dufton (20 miles)
This is by far my favourite section of the trail. The day begins by following the river Tees, with the impressive waterfalls at Low Force and High Force. There is a section below cliffs leading to another waterfall at Cauldron Snout. The day finished with High Cup Nick, possibly one of the best views in England.

This section includes Cross Fell (893m/2,930ft), the highest point of the Pennine Way.

# Alston to Greenhead
# Greenhead to Bellingham
# Bellingham to Byrness
# Byrness to Kirk Yetholm (2 day section)
